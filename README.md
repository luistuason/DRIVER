# DRIVER
A road safety data science project

Objectives:
1. Count the number of incidents per city/municipality in NCR and outside NCR
2. Filter data for NCR only, then count by city/municipality and month/year
3. Plot the data from #2 in a graph with time (mm/yy) in the x-axis and count in the y-axis
  --> 1 plot with multiple lines, colored by city/municipality
  --> 1 plot with single line, for all NCR combined
4. Have 3-5 questions related to the assignment
5. For Dr. Reina: research on how to tag incident Lon-Lat to OSM roads
  --> Also try "Intersect" on data with Roads_NCR.shp on QGIS
